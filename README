Introduction
============

This software can be used to generate PhotoMosaics - that is, images which are
themselves composed of hundreds or thousands of tiny images. It is still in
early developmental stages but is perfectly usable.

This version of PhotoMosaic is for GIMP v2. I do not know if it is compatible
with GIMP v1.x. If necessary you can get a version that works with GIMP v1
from my CPAN directory (CPAN ID = SDRABBLE).


Installation
============

Untar the package file to your GIMP directory:

  $  cd ~/.gimp-2.0/
  $  gunzip -c /path/to/<PMOSAIC>.tar.gz | tar xf - 

(replace <PMOSAIC> in the above command with the full version number from the
filename)

The software will be extracted to the 'plug-ins' directory.

Before using the photomosaic software please run at least the pmosaic.t and
photomean.t tests to verify correct installation and functionality. These can
be found in the t/ directory from wherever you untarred the package.

  $  cd plug-ins/t
  $  perl ./photomean.t
  $  perl ./pmosaic.t

Note you can also use the 'runtests' script in the t/ directory.

These tests may take a while to run depending on the speed and other
configuration of your system.

If everything passes you are all set! If not, I'll be glad to work with you to
get it running.


Using the Software
==================

Start GIMP. You should see two new options on the Xtns/Perl-Fu menu of the
main toolbox. 

  photomean

and

  pmosaic

Although these are provided in the GIMP's menu system it is recommended for
performance reasons that they be run from the command-line or in batch. See
the in-line documentation for full details.


Creating Mosaics
================

For best results, the more photos in your library the better. I recommend
around 4000 at an absolute minimum. 7-8000 should be adequate.

If you create any really nice photomosaics with this software email the author
and I'll consider adding them to the pmosaic home page at
http://thebigmachine.org/gimp/pmosaic/

Happy Mosaicking!
