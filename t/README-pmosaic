This file describes the tests for the pmosaic and photomean software. All
tests and benchmarks should be run from the t/ directory where the test
scripts live. Sample library and source images should live in img/ under this
directory. The test scripts themselves expect to find the pmosaic and
photomean scripts in the parent directory:

  /path/to/scripts/pmosaic
                   photomean
                   t/pmosaic.t
                     photomean.t
                     photomean.t
                     img/    # sample library and source images


pmosaic.t
---------
This test suite verifies correct functionality of the pmosaic software.
Several scenarios are run to test basic photomosaic creation, including
interrupting and subsequently continuing processes.


photomean.t
-----------
This test suite verifies correct functionality of the photomean software. 


mosaic-profile.sh
-----------------
This script profiles the pmosaic software.


mosaic-tolerance-compare.sh
-----------------------------
This is used to benchmark the pmosaic software for various tolerance values.


Sample Images
-------------
The testcard.png image was created by drawing a black rectangle then colouring
the lower and right edges white. The middle of the rectangle was then filled in
with two gradients - full spectrum in the top half, and white-to-black
greyscale in the bottom half. This image was then used to generate a png for
each colour found in the gradients (including black and white). These pngs are
used as the photo library for testing and benchmarking.

testcardr.png is a copy of testcard.png with the central gradients reversed.

The pmosaic-index-munged in the t/ directory has deliberately had random bits
flipped for each colour. This is so the pick_best_match() function will
perform a full search, for benchmarking purposes.
